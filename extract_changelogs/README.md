# CVE Mapping Process

This playbook will do the following:

* Pull the container image from specified registry
* Run and mount a container
* List the packages in the container image
* Dump the changelogs
* Stop and unmount container
* Loop for all images in the list 

The CVEs in the changelogs can then be used as a cross reference to the CVEs in a report. Any CVEs found in the changelogs has been patched.
