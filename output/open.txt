Description:     CVE-2018-6954 systemd: Mishandled symlinks in systemd-tmpfiles allows local users to obtain ownership of arbitrary files
Statement:       This flaw affects in particular those systems where custom tmpfiles files are configured (e.g. in /etc/tmpfiles.d). Indeed systemd-tmpfiles installed by system packages set privileges of a directory either to root or to a service specific user and not to interactive users. Even in case they provide one of the vulnerable tmpfiles configuration file (e.g. recursive "Z" type entries), an attacker would still need to perform the attack as the service specific user, which means they would first need to compromise that service. Moreover, systemd-tmpfiles service is automatically executed only when the system boots, when it is very unlikely an attacker has already a chance to perform any action at all. Otherwise, an attacker would have to wait for an administrator to manually run the `systemd-tmpfiles --create` command.

Statement:       For the attack to be successful, a new session must be created by pam_systemd. This is done only if the calling process is not already part of a session. Red Hat Enterprise Linux, in its default PAM configurations, does not let a session sneak in without systemd knowing about it, since pam_systemd is always called in every PAM config file. Unless a wrong PAM config file is in place, this vulnerability cannot be triggered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8.

Resolution:      
Severity:        medium
Description:     CVE-2019-17498 libssh2: integer overflow in SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c
Statement:       This flaw needs a malicious MITM SSH server. When an application compiled with libssh2 connects to such a MITM SSH server, the server can trigger an integer overflow leading to an OOB read in the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic. This can cause the application compiled with libssh2 to crash. This is strictly a client side crash and the SSH server may not be affected. Also note that when a user connects to a malicious MITM server there is already a risk of disclosing password/keys irrespective of the flaw.

Severity:        medium
Description:     CVE-2020-13776 systemd: mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits
Statement:       The flaw is rated as Moderate because several uncommon conditions have to be met to make it exploitable. Numerical usernames with decimal digits or starting with "0x" followed by hexadecimal digits must exist on the system. Systemd would need to process those particular usernames (e.g. while using the `User=` directive in a systemd service unit). If the service was supposed to run as a regular user and the binary being executed can be controlled by a local attacker, he could abuse this flaw to unexpectedly execute code as a root when the service is started. If the service was run as a regular user to limit the impact of a possible flaw in the service, this flaw would not provide the intended additional protection.

The attack leading to this flaw, is difficult to conduct in practice especially for cross-vm environments, mainly because the attacker needs to run their timing attack script at the exact same time decryption runs on the victim machine. Also this is essentially a chosen ciphertext attack because the attacker provides the ciphertext which the victim needs to be decrypt. Such actions only work when there is sufficient social engineer involved.

Description:     CVE-2019-19203 oniguruma: heap-based buffer over-read in function gb18030_mbc_enc_len in file gb18030.c
Statement:       This flaw did not affect the versions of Oniguruma (embedded in php) as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, as they did not include support for GB18030 character encoding, which was introduced in a later version of the library. The versions of Ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections 3 do not use Oniguruma but rather Onigmo, a regular expressions library forked from Oniguruma focusing on new expressions supported in Perl 5.10+. Those versions are affected by this flaw because both Onigmo and Oniguruma share the same vulnerable code. However, Ruby does perform additional checks which prevent the vulnerable code path to be easily reached, hence lowering the severity of the flaw.

Statement:       While OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release. Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time. The PKI module as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release. The version of jackson-databind as shipped in Red Hat Software Collections rh-maven35 is used only while building maven, thus it does not deserialize data coming from untrusted sources, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product.

Statement:       While OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release. Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time. The PKI module as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release. The version of jackson-databind as shipped in Red Hat Software Collections rh-maven35 is used only while building maven, thus it does not deserialize data coming from untrusted sources, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product.

CVE-2019-17571 has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux via RHSA-2017:2423. Also the rh-java-common-log4j package shipped with Red Hat Software Collections was addressed via RHSA-2017:1417 In Satellite 5.8, although the version of log4j as shipped in the nutch package is affected, nutch does not load any of the SocketServer classes from log4j. Satellite 5 is considered not vulnerable to this flaw since the affected code can not be reached.

Statement:       PyYAML in channels for Red Hat MRG Messaging 2 should no longer be used, as a newer version is now available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Newer packages should be consumed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels. This issue affects the versions of the PyYAML package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Satellite 5. A future update may address this issue. The PyYAML libary that is provided in the Red Hat OpenStack repositories is vulnerable. However, there are no instances where this library is used in a way which exposes the vulnerability. Any updates will be through the RHEL channels.
