Indeed systemd-tmpfiles installed by system packages set privileges of a directory either to root or to a service specific user and not to interactive users. Even in case they provide one of the vulnerable tmpfiles configuration file (e.g. recursive "Z" type entries), an attacker would still need to perform the attack as the service specific user, which means they would first need to compromise that service. Moreover, systemd-tmpfiles service is automatically executed only when the system boots, when it is very unlikely an attacker has already a chance to perform any action at all. Otherwise, an attacker would have to wait for an administrator to manually run the `systemd-tmpfiles --create` command."

Some advice about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231 This issue affects the versions of jackson-databind (in Satellite 6.0 and 6.1) and candlepin (which embeds a copy of jackson-databind in Satellite 6.2) as shipped with Red Hat Satellitw 6.x. However the affected code is NOT used at this time: Candlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected. However as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked. Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager version 1 is now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates."
