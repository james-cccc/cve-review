Description:     CVE-2016-4484 dracut: Brute force attack on LUKS password decryption via initramfs
Statement:       In Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, the scripts used during boot time to ask for user password and decrypt the drive are part of the dracut package. They used to generate the Initial ramdisk (initramfs) and are a part of the initramfs image file. The attacker needs to have physical access to the machine in order to exploit this flaw. The attack consists of gaining access to the shell after wrong luks password has been entered during the boot process. Once shell access is obtained various brute force attacks (both manual and automated) can be carried out. The contents of the drive can also be copied off to do conduct offline brute force attacks on another computer. Red Hat Product Security encourages users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 to use the mitigation described in the link below. No updated packages are currently available.

Severity:        medium
Description:     CVE-2016-2183 SSL/TLS: Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers (SWEET32)
Statement:       OpenSSL security update RHSA-2016:1940 mitigates this issue by lowering priority of DES cipher suites so they are not preferred over cipher suites using AES. For compatibility reasons, DES cipher suites remain enabled by default and included in the set of cipher suites identified by the HIGH cipher string. Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not enable them by default. NSS addressed this issue by implementing limits on the amount of plain text which can be encrypted by using the same key. Once the limit is reached, the keys will need to be re-negotiated manually. This change will be available in nss-3.27. GnuTLS is not affected by this issue, since it prioritizes AES before 3DES in the cipher list.

Statement:       The /proc filesystem is not a reliable mechanism to account for processes running on a system, as it is unable to offer snapshot semantics. Short-lived processes have always been able to escape detection by tools that monitor /proc. This CVE simply identifies a reliable way to do so using inotify. Process accounting for security purposes, or with a requirement to record very short-running processes and those attempting to evade detection, should be performed with more robust methods such as auditd(8) (the Linux Audit Daemon) or systemtap.

Description:     CVE-2017-7526 libgcrypt: Use of left-to-right sliding window method allows full RSA key recovery
Statement:       This side-channel attack requires that the attacker can run arbitrary software on the hardware where the private RSA key is used. Allowing execute access to a box with private keys should be considered as an unsafe security practice, anyway. Thus in practice there are easier ways to access the private keys than to mount this side-channel attack. However, on boxes with virtual machines this attack may be used by one VM to steal private keys from another VM.

This CVE assignment was disputed by upstream. While an attack is theoretically possible, it relies on a programming pattern in the vulnerable Python program that is generally considered bad practice if not an outright bug.

Description:     CVE-2016-4429 glibc: libtirpc: stack (frame) overflow in Sun RPC clntudp_call()
Statement:       Based on technical analysis of this flaw: On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6: No looping behaviour was observed. Without the looping behavior, the alloca should be harmless for pretty much all applications because the size argument depends on the size of the generated (outgoing) UDP packet and will be well below default stack sizes. Therefore it is not affected by this flaw. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7: Looping behaviour was observed and segfaults with small stack sizes. -fstack-class-protection will turn this into a reliable crash (no code execution possible). Even without that build flag, this will not be exploitable in most cases because the application determines the alloca argument, based on the generated UDP packet (not the response). This will usually be smaller than a page. The maximum impact is therefore crash, there is no code execution involved. This issue was fixed in glibc-2.23.1, therefore Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw.

Severity:        high
Description:     CVE-2019-12749 dbus: DBusServer DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication bypass
Statement:       This flaw is mitigated by the fact that by default, the well-known system dbus-daemon (since 2003) and the well-known session dbus-daemon (in stable releases since dbus 1.10.0 in 2015) only accept the EXTERNAL authentication mechanism, and as a result will reject DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 at an early stage, before manipulating cookies. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is affected by this flaw, which can be leveraged to achieve privilege escalation via upstart. This issue has been rated as having important impact for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8, both ship dbus >= 1.10 and therefore are affected by this flaw only when system or session dbus-daemons are used under non-standard configurations or by third party users of DBusServer. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 does not ship any affected DBusServer cosumer. However third party applications may be affected.

For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/. This attack requires - An attacker to be able to write to the ACPI tables ( local, privileged operation and non generalized attacks) - The ability for the attacker to reboot the system ( local, privileged operation ) - The ACPI table changes to persist through reboots ( not common on cloud/serverless platforms ) - This modification to the table alone is able to possibly corrupt memory, but the corruption will not be enough alone, the corrupted affected memory will be overwritten with valid acpi struct data which also has to corrupt the memory in which a way the flaw can create abuse (HARD). - The attacker will find it significantly difficult to abuse this a flaw in early-boot as injecting code/controlled execution at this point would require privileges. If an attacker had this specific privilege, there are easier ways to gain privilege escalation.

Description:     CVE-2020-10109 python-twisted: HTTP request smuggling when presented with a Content-Length and a chunked Transfer-Encoding header
Statement:       Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform packages the flawed code, python-twisted's web.HTTP functionality is not used in the RHOSP environment. For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been lowered to moderate. OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 and later includes `python-twisted` as a dependency of `python-prometheus_client` in Ironic container images, however the affected code is not used. Red Hat Satellite uses affected versions of `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` modules in Pulp, however, it is not vulnerable since `http` modal of web implementation is not expose in product. Red Hat Satellite may update `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` in future. This issue affects the version of python-twisted(embedded in calamari-server) shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. However, calamari is no longer supported, hence the embedded python-twisted package will not be fixed.

Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected. However as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked. JBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices.

Statement:       JBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advice about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231 This issue affects the versions of jackson-databind (in Satellite 6.0 and 6.1) and candlepin (which embeds a copy of jackson-databind in Satellite 6.2) as shipped with Red Hat Satellitw 6.x. However the affected code is NOT used at this time: Candlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected. However as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked. Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager version 1 is now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

Therefore, the prerequisites for this vulnerability are not present and OpenDaylight is not affected. This vulnerability relies on logback-core (ch.qos.logback.core) being present in the application's ClassPath. Logback-core is not packaged as an RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Software Collections. Applications using jackson-databind that do not also use logback-core are not impacted by this vulnerability. This issue affects the versions of jackson-databind bundled with candlepin as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6.x. However the affected code is NOT used at this time.

Statement:       This issue is rated as having Low impact because of the preconditions needed to trigger the error/resource cleanup code path (system-wide out-of-memory condition, high privileges or physical access). The attacker would have to be able to induce system-wide out-of-memory condition which itself could be seen as a local denial of service. It could be argued that having such privileges has the same impact as the flaw itself.
