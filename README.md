# cve-review

The current process is broken up into two elements. More is to be done and this is still very much under development.

Ansible - With a list of given images it will pull an image, run the container, mount the container, export the list packages, export changelogs, unmount container, stop the container and then continue to loop through for all the images in the list. This will generate directories with the relevant changelogs for each package for each image of a release. We can use these changelogs to verify if CVEs have been resolved.

Shell - With the json output of a JFrog Xray report this script will extract all the CVEs which will then be used to cross-reference them against our previously exported changelogs. This process for the Jenkins image highlighted around 25-30% of the CVEs were apparent in the changelogs, so we can be assured these are most likely false positives XRay is picking up due to it not taking backports into account. This script will also query the Red Hat Security Data API and pull down the relevant CVE reports. 

# Next Steps:
* Unrealted issues are maybe not so unrelated. Need to check and wildcard for cpe
