# cve-review

The current process is broken up into two elements. More is to be done and this is still very much under development.

### Ansible 
With a list of given images it will pull an image, run the container, mount the container, export the list packages, export changelogs, unmount container, stop the container and then continue to loop through for all the images in the list. This will generate directories with the relevant changelogs for each package for each image of a release. We can use these changelogs to verify if CVEs have been resolved. I've also included a sample script in the extract_changelogs directory which with the json output of a JFrog Xray report this script will extract all the CVEs which will then be used to cross-reference them against our previously exported changelogs. This process for the Jenkins image highlighted around 25-30% of the CVEs were apparent in the changelogs, so we can be assured these are most likely false positives XRay is picking up due to it not taking backports into account. This script will also query the Red Hat Security Data API and pull down the relevant CVE reports, however I've now moved the API calls to a seperate script, the reason for doing this is to maybe provide a more simple generic report rather than to go into the nth degree. 

### API Script
This script will query the Red Hat security data API and the Red Hat bugzilla API to produce a little overview report based on a list of CVEs.
